    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>I'm interested in knowing the latests trends on technology and emergent technologies as well, nowadays I am really interested in the fast paced field of Artificial Intelligence, how to use it and in which fields it can be applied, like doing automated pieces of art, changing the voice to sound like famous actors and many uses more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Videogames</h2>
            <p>Videogaming is more than just a pastime; it's an interactive art form that combines storytelling, strategy, and hand-eye coordination, more on online multiplayer, I feel that by doing my hobby I also get more reflexes, better response time and I polish my teamworking abilities</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Cycling</h2>
            <p>Cycling in Costa Rica is a challenge, with many mountains on where I live riding long distances are dificult but the landscapes and the freedom that I feel when cycling is worth the dificulty of it, also when I conmute to another town I feel that I'm helping the ambient by not using my car and not contaminanting.</p>
